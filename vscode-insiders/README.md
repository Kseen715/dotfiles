# VSCode Insiders (code-insiders) config

I'm sharing this config to keep track of my settings and extensions for VSCode Insiders:

- `settings.json` - User settings
- `keybindings.json` - User keybindings
- `extensions.json` - Extensions list
- `snippets` - User snippets

## Usage

`User` folder can be found at:

- `~/.config/Code - Insiders/User` on Linux
- `%APPDATA%\Code - Insiders\User` (`C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\Code - Insiders\User`) on Windows

`extensions` folder can be found at:

- `~/.vscode-insiders/extensions` on Linux
- `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode-insiders\extensions` (`C:\Users\{username}\.vscode-insiders\extensions`) on Windows

## Usage with regular VSCode

> [!NOTE]
> This config is for VSCode Insiders, but it can be used with the regular VSCode as well. Though, the paths will be different and some extensions might not work.

Just replace `Code - Insiders` with `Code` in the paths above. This should work for both settings and extensions.
